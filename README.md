# Product-Placement-Recommendation-System
In this project I first compared three different types of clustering models KMeans, DBscan and Hierarchichal clustering. For comparison of these models I used the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index which provides information on the objects in the clusters.
Out of the three models, K-means clustering performed the best, thus we will use the K-means clustering model for the product placement layout recommendation system.
Here, I have taken a dataset of the Retail sales of a Grocery Store which contains information of the people's buying history and their bill and the region and different categories of grocery items.
